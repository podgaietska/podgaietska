### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to code and build cool stuff! Always exploring new technologies and improving my craft.

Currently a 4th-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, doing a 16-month co-op.

I'm a Software Developer Intern at Pason and the VP of Software Development at Student Energy UofC, where I get to work on some cool projects!
